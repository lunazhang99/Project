    <p class="bio">Hi! My name is Luna Zhang, and I am from Newton, Massachusetts.
        I am a first generation college student at Babson College,
        concentrating in Operations Management and Information Technology Management.
        I am passionate about global supply chain, product management,
        and problem solving through design thinking, and hope to find a
        future in the creative part of the business world. As an organized
        and results driven worker, I thrive in fast-paced environments
        and aim to pursue challenges outside of my comfort zone.</p>

    <p class="bio">This summer, I am interning for Bigbelly Solar, a waste management company
        that provides smart and sustainable solutions for cities. The company was founded
        at my college as well as Olin College of Engineering. I was drawn to the company's
        initiative to reduce energy usage and increase efficiency through their solar powered
        trash cans. I work closely with the Finance and Operations team to execute numerous
        tasks such as: managing the Credit and Collections process in order to help the company
        lower their Receivables, fulfilling shipment orders on Netsuite, and creating and customizing
        Salesforce reports. Working in a startup environment has been such a rewarding experience-the
        company is a tight knit community and I have learned a lot from my co-workers. </p>
    <br>
    <p class="bio">In addition to Bigbelly, you can find me at Starbucks making drinks every Sunday.
        I have been a barista at Starbucks since I was in high school. Although it may not seem like it,
        being a barista has been one of the toughest jobs I have ever worked. I am constantly on my feet
        making drinks, stocking items, and making sure that customers are satisfied. The job requires a lot
        of multitasking and being two steps ahead at all times. The biggest skill I have gained from being a
        barista is learning how to work in a team setting-each barista has their own job, and if one barista is
        struggling, we all do what we can to support them so that our store is performing at its best. My coworkers
        are some of the most genuine and interesting people I have ever met, and seeing my favorite customers always
        makes my day.</p>

    <p class="bio">As an incoming junior in college, I am still exploring different career paths through taking
        various courses. Currently, I am pursuing a career in product management and operations management with
        hopes of landing a career that will allow me to explore my interests . My eventual goal is to be a product
        manager-a role where I am able to participate in design process but also manage the operations and brand aspect
        of the product as well. I am also interested in finding ways to make current supply chains more sustainable in
        the future, and would love to work with companies that are bringing supply chain management to the next level.

    <h1 class="title">FUN FACTS ABOUT ME</h1>
    <ol class="bio">
        <img class="pics" src="ProjectImages/sp_dogswim-1024x536.jpg" alt="pup" title="pup" height="200">
        <li>I am a swimmer and swam for Babson during my freshman year. Sadly, I got injured,
            so my D3 athletic career only lasted for a year.</li>
        <li>I am OBSESSED with dogs. Anyone who knows me know that I would do anything to have a puppy in my life.
            Sadly, I do not own a dog because my mom said having twins is enough stress in her life. </li>
        <li>As stated above, I have a twin brother. His name is Nick and he is also a junior at Northeastern
            studying Chemical Engineering. Essentially, he is the genius half and likes doing math for fun.
            Sometimes I wish we were identical because he could take my tests for me but then I realized that
            he could also steal my clothes so I'm glad he's a boy.</li>
        <li>
            I am in an acapella group (shoutout to my aca-altos!). I am a member of the Babson Rocket Pitches
            Acapella Group but I have been studying music since I was a child. My father is a professional opera
            singer and my mother is a professional er hu (chinese instrument) player, so I was surrounded by music
            my whole life.
        </li>
        <li>
            I am in a sorority-Kappa Kappa Gamma. I was previously the Education Chair, and planned programs for
            seniors and brought in professional speakers to talk to our girls at chapter.
        </li>

        If you've gotten this far, I just wanted to say thank you for taking the time to explore my portfolio.
        Putting myself out there took a lot of courage and hard work, so I really appreciate anyone who took the
        time to scroll through my work. Shout-out to my family and friends who have supported me since day 1.
        You all keep me grounded. Much love xx
