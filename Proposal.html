    <h1>Website Proposal</h1>
    <h3>What is my website about></h3> 
    <p>I want to make my website a personal portfolio that contains fashion and digital designs that I have made. I currently have a personal website through Adobe Portfolio which I am paying for so I want to be able to make it myself too, so that I can add my personal aesthetic to the website. </p>
    <h3>Why is this site important?</h3>
    <p>This website is important because I can showcase my work to future employers. I want to hopefully get into the design industry, so having a portfolio is vital. </p>
    <h3>Target Audience</h3>
    <p>My target audience is employers, friends and family, and also people who are interested in my work.</p>
    <h3>Potential Content</h3>
    <p>I will be posting my fashion designs, digital designs, social media branding, events I have participated in, and an About Me page</p>
